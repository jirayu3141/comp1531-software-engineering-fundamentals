# Time estimation
We have 3 weeks (20 days) to complete this iteration.

# Break them up into logical bucket
Function groups are broken up as follows: auth, channel, message, users, stand-up, search and admin

We plan to do **auth fucntions** together to get the hang of fucntion-writings. 
- Authentications - 3 days
- Authentication_debug - 1 day

**Channel funcitons** will be written by Sojin. Channel fucntions will be the first to start as some other funcitons rely on channel based function (details in timeline)
- Channel fucntions - 6 days
- Channel debug - 2 days

**Message functions** will be written by Jirayu(Peter) and Theekapat (Earth)
- Message functions - 5 days
- Messagedebug - 2 days

**User functions** will be written by Sojin over the course of 5 days
- User functions - 5 days
- User debug - 2 day

- Standup fucntions - 2 days
- Debug - 1 day

Fairuz and Sojin will write **search and admin functions**
