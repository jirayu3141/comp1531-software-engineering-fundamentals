# Reflection

Timing and outcome of team meetings: 
In total, we had 5 meetings altogether. During our first meeting (30 Sep), we collaboratively worked on project’s user stories by running through each feature for Slackr. We also agreed that we would be using Slack as our means of communication to familiarise ourselves with the app’s features. During lab hour, we discussed about the structure of the tests and how we would use git to work together. In addition, we discussed about how testing functions would be allocated. As for the third meeting (3rd Oct), we started planning for iteration 2, as well as started working on the reflection (reflection outline). Final meeting was on (4th Oct). Team's reflection and planning were finalized. We also ran through all the tests for each fucntion together to see what can be improved upon. Finally, branches were merged to get files ready for submission. 

# Distribution of tasks

To ensure fair contribution of tasks, untion tests were divided equally. Each of us were responsible for writing around 8 tests, as well as assumptions for the corresponding functions. As for the remaining tasks (ie. user stories, reflection and planning), we worked together during meetings to ensure that everyone agreed with the tasks' outcomes.

# Areas for improvement

One of the problems we had is that meetings were inefficent, thus frequent meetings were required. We often find ourselves distracted and did not purely work on the project. Upon writing reflection, We raised the issue and agreed that we would not work on unrelated tasks. Despite having meeting outlines, they were not followed strictly. Additionally, we inaccurately predicted the time required to complete a tasks. We learnt that assignment spec should be read more thoroughly to improve our estimation of time required. Some of our members were also uncertain about the application's feature. Therefore, we started using Slack to improve our understanding of the project requirements.
 
# How we worked collaboratively

Our group had frequent meetings to discuss issues that we were individually facing, and helped each other to resolve these struggles as a team. Asides from completing the user stories as a group, together, we wrote a sample function test to ensure that all team members were on the same page so that. Additionally, as a means of communication we adopted Slack to use as the main means of communication and share relevant resource.


# Process for any disagreement

Where disagreement may arises, our group agreed that problems would be discussed as a team. We would also to find a combined solution to the best of our abilities. In rare circumstances where conflicts cannot be resolved, we will follow the majority's opinion.

# Methodology for Completing this Iteration

We started the project by doing user stoires as a team to understand the project purpose. We began by watching video resources provided by our lecturer to understand the projects' requirement. This is to ensure that the correct formats are followed. After geting a good sense of understading for the requirement, we began coding testing fucntions. Doubts and queries would be disucess in group chat or during meetings. Once all tests were written, we went through each function together to come up with test cases. Finally, we reflected on the past meetings' efficiency and how we can imporve/grow as a team
